PROMPT: Build the “MI Path” App (by Muskan Immigration)

Goal: Create a responsive PWA app named MI Path (Powered by Muskan Immigration) that matches our website style and later can be published on the Play Store via TWA. The app must include IRCC updates, Visa Types (docs/procedure/time/fees), lead capture to Airtable, and direct links to our website and Microsoft registration form.
